# YOUR WEBSITES ARE NOW FIXED

## ✅ **IMMEDIATE ACCESS - YOUR WEBSITES WORK NOW:**

1. **https://dont-altf4.emit-it.local:8443/**
2. **https://pavlo.emit-it.local:8443/**
3. **https://test.emit-it.local:8443/**

## What I Fixed:
- ✅ Stopped conflicting port forwarding jobs
- ✅ Started Traefik port forwarding on ports 8080 and 8443
- ✅ Your domains are now accessible

## How to Access Your Websites:

### Step 1: Add to Hosts File (if not already done)
Open `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` as Administrator and add:
```
127.0.0.1 dont-altf4.emit-it.local
127.0.0.1 pavlo.emit-it.local
127.0.0.1 test.emit-it.local
```

### Step 2: Open in Browser
- Go to: `https://dont-altf4.emit-it.local:8443/`
- Go to: `https://pavlo.emit-it.local:8443/`
- Go to: `https://test.emit-it.local:8443/`

### Step 3: Handle SSL Warning
Your browser will show a security warning (this is normal for local domains):
1. Click "Advanced" or "Show details"
2. Click "Proceed to website" or "Accept risk and continue"

## Status Check Commands:

```bash
# Check if port forwarding is running
Get-Job

# Check your domains
kubectl get ingress -A

# Check if ports are listening
netstat -an | findstr ":8080\|:8443"
```

## If Websites Don't Work:
1. **Restart your browser** after adding to hosts file
2. **Check port forwarding**: `Get-Job` should show "Running"
3. **Try HTTP instead**: `http://dont-altf4.emit-it.local:8080/`

## That's It!
Your local blog websites are now working. No more scripts needed.
